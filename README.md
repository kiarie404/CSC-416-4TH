# CSC-416-4TH
Fourth Year Project : Building a Rust-Kernel that uses WASI interface system calls as its native system calls. Runs on top of emulated Riscv Chip. And runs wasm modules in Ring 0.  
A proof of concept that Rust+wasm integration in embedded Oses and IoT deployment boosts Capability-based Security and encourages true portability. This is done in comparison to docker + C solutions.
