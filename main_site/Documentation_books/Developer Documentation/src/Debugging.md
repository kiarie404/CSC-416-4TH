# Debugging

This chapter explains the debugging approaches used in the project.  
1. THe good old print statements
2. The GDB debugger in a no_std environment (A complete life savior)
3. Touching grass, Taking showers, replaying skyrim as a modded mage, replaying the entire far-cry franchise, Dying Light 1 and Exapunks. Finishing it up with a mixture of ecchi and slice of life anime.
