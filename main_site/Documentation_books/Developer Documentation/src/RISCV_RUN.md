# RISCV_RUN

RiscV ISA will be used for a long time.  
If you intend to make unique robots with unique circuits, then you may need to learn RISCV.  

Why?    
It is open source, meaning you can print your own circuits without paying IP fees.  
It is open source, meaning you can understand it in and out. No black-holes. Before you can tweak something uniquely, you have to first understand its current implementation through and through.  
It is opensource, meaning you can add your own extensions without paying IP fees.   

It is an open standard, you can be assured that if individual RiscV companies fall, you will not get stalled    
You have the power to create ASICs and make them follow the Riscv ISA for compatibility. If let's say you come up wuth a new circuit design or implementation using molecule circuits or cells.... whatever... you may just extend the RISCV Base ISA, And that extension can be used as a standard to. Or rather, it may be a standard to those who use it. 

The Riscv ISA is modular, You have the option of choosing to deal with only a subset of the instructions. Meaning the hardware will support only the instrutions you want. No more general ISAs with baggage hardware. You can create small circuits that are enough.   

It has few instructions, It is simple. It is not an Inremental ISA


**problem**  
You am trying to write an OS.  
I do not like the way I have been reading snippets of the RiscV manual from blogs, chatgpt, book_chapters...  
I am having a hard time truly understanding things. I think the best way to learn it would be to try to read it whole.   


Ok ... instead of whole, I will just read on the riviledged ISA. I currently do not care much about Unpriviledged ISA because such code can be written in higher level languages
