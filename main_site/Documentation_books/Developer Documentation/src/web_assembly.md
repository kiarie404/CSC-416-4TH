# Web Assembly

why?
- sandbox security
- portability
  - universal APIs 
  - anything that has the runtime
  - any language as source
  - Glueing together languages (in development modules + package system)
  - cloud updates for IoT (you don't have to worry about compilation )
  - Keeping up with ubiquitous computing (heterogenous devices)
- Standard application inspection for security (3rd party)
