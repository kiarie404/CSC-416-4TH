# Using A Wasm Runtime in a no-std environment

References :
> Programming WebAssembly with Rust - Book by Kevin Hoffman.   The book does a good job of explaining how to use web assembly in a non_web environment. It even explains how to handle web assembly in a no-std environment. This is a Chad Book. A Total Hit. A Landslide win of a book. I am not kidding, and I am not exagerrating it.  ===>     Relevant chapters : 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8


Wasm runtimes can run in a no-std environment.  
This chapter discusses how to do that.  
As for the deeper theory behind it, kindly take your time parsing through the mentioned chapters of the Book referenced above. It is an awesome read.
