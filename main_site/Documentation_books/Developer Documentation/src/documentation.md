3. Git/Github - For continuous maintainance and storage
4. Mermaid : For drawing state diagrams, schemas, graphs, flowcharts... using text/code.
5. Excalidraw : For drawing diagrams
6. RustDocs : generating documentation from comments within the code and publishing it to crates.io

Future desires [undone]
- draw the whole system design on one piece of canvas.
- Let the canvas hve an infinite zoom feature.
- The user can then zoom in and out infinitely. From the high level components to the actual code_state diagrams
- The above system should probably use markdown, mdbooks, excalidraw, mermaid.js
- Uses nested state diagrams to describe code --- mermaid.js state diagrams  

Even more future [undone]
- attach chat-gpt like querying within the system design diagram
