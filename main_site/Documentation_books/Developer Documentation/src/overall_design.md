##### Late desigs

Let us be on the same page:
1. People romantisize heroic statements
2. Someone who understands something gains the ability to explain things well
3. You can only say you truly understand something if you can recreate it. (given enough time and resources).

heroic things like ; 
    - do hard things
    - be innovative
    - Implement time travelling

The thing is, these things are ugly on the ground. People fail terribly, no matter how obssessed they were.  
An innovator faces the risk of being wrong and poor.  They may be a liitle lucky and be right but poor. It is very hard to be truly innovative.

If you were given 2 years to implement time travel, chances are half way you will still not have understood what you are doing. You won't have understood the implementation. You won't have the desigs. The designs will keep on changing.
