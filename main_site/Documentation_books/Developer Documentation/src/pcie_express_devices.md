PCIe devices are attached to pin 32 upto 35  

PCI Express (PCIe) is a high-speed serial computer expansion bus standard used for connecting various components in a computer system. PCIe devices are devices that can be plugged into the PCIe slots on a motherboard to add functionality to a computer system. Here are some examples of PCIe devices:

    Graphics cards: PCIe is commonly used to connect graphics cards to a motherboard, allowing for high-speed data transfer between the graphics card and the CPU.

    Network interface cards: PCIe can also be used to connect network interface cards, providing high-speed network connectivity to a computer system.

    Sound cards: PCIe can be used to add high-quality audio processing capabilities to a computer system.

    Solid-state drives: PCIe-based solid-state drives (SSDs) offer much faster data transfer speeds compared to traditional SATA-based SSDs.

    USB expansion cards: PCIe can be used to add additional USB ports to a computer system, providing more connectivity options for peripherals.

    RAID controllers: PCIe-based RAID controllers can be used to add additional storage capacity to a computer system, allowing for data redundancy and improved data access speeds.

Overall, PCIe is a versatile and widely used standard for connecting various devices to a computer system, offering high-speed data transfer and low latency.
