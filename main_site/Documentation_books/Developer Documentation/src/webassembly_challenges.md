# webassembly_challenges

#### learning
Positives :
- new, so many possibilities... (we can basically be pioneers and steer the direction of the technology)
- many research papers
- active development on_going, so there are discussions happening
- 
negatives : 
- a lot of tools are browser_based. My interest is on non_web uses of webassembly
