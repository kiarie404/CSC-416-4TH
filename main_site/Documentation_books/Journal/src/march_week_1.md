# Week 1

### 1st Mar
- [x] Skim through the [rcore tutorial](http://rcore-os.cn/rCore-Tutorial-Book-v3/index.html), and determine if we can use it to build for riscv CPU.  (It is not, the translated version is hard to understand. The tutorial is too detailed, it will take too much time)

### 2nd Mar
- [x] Start reading on how to compile a rust program to run on bare metal riscv CPU (the CPU will be emulated by Qemu)

### 5th Mar
- [x] Start reading on how to compile a rust program to run on bare metal riscv CPU (the CPU will be emulated by Qemu)
