# Week 1

### 1st Mar
- [x] Skim through the [rcore tutorial](http://rcore-os.cn/rCore-Tutorial-Book-v3/index.html), and determine if we can use it to build for riscv CPU.  (It is not, the translated version is hard to understand. The tutorial is too detailed, it will take too much time)

### 2nd Mar
- [x] Start reading on how to compile a rust program to run on bare metal riscv CPU (the CPU will be emulated by Qemu)

### 5th Mar
- [x] Start reading on how to compile a rust program to run on bare metal riscv CPU (the CPU will be emulated by Qemu)

### 6th Mar
- [x] Read up on the [Qemu Risc V Emulator](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/target-riscv.html); Specifically the [Risc v virtual board](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/riscv/virt.html).
- [x] Wrap my head around all this completely unnecessary and backwards Makefiles jargon. By following [this blog's tutorial](https://makefiletutorial.com/)

### 7th Mar
- [x] Set up Qemu and Rust(no_std) for riscv
- [x] Learn basic riscv Assembly {code structure, common directives} 

### 8th Mar
- [x] Learn Rust Metaprogramming from [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html)
- [x] Learn how to write the UART driver in Rust for the RISCV (emulated by Qemu)
