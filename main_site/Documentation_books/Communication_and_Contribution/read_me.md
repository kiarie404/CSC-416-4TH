This is the Communication and contribution section.  
Under this section, a general to-do list is displayed. There is a comment section below available for disussing the to-do list or anything related to the Project.    
Developers can discuss the relevance of the to-do list items, task allocation, task propositions... anything.  


The comment section has been built with [Giscus](https://giscus.app/). Giscus is based on [Github Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions). Discussions are for conversations that need to be transparent and accessible but do not need to be tracked on a project board and are not related to code, unlike GitHub Issues. Discussions enable fluid, open conversation in a public forum.  

Discussions give a space for more collaborative conversations by connecting and giving a more centralized area to connect and find information.
