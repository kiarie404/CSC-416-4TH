Ebu read your notes + Riscv official book on the reasons why RISCV.  
Also read on RISCV and AIoT. This will be one of your selling point as to why you are building for RISCV hardware.

#### Why ARM and x86?
- They are popular, huge support
- Backward compatibility

#### Why not ARM and x86
- Backward compatibility makes the CPU heavy and complex.
- They have a complex ISA. Very hard to learn. Very hard. You have to learn legacy to get to modern
- They are proprietary (limited modification of ISA, limited production). We are in the 21st century... CPU knowledge needs to be standard
- It is not possible to form new innovatie products when dealing with a blackbox

#### Why Riscv?
- Free ISA design... ou can modify it
- Made to be extended... free to extend
- Modular --- uses extensions instead of compacting everything as it was done in other ISAs
- Simpler ISA
- Opensource and Standard... no closed designs...it is likely to last time

#### Why not Riscv?
- unpopular.... but it will be the mainstream within the next few years. At least for embedded computers.
- No other reason

"From a certain perspective, the core goal of the emerging RISC-V is to flexibly adapt to future AIoT (Artificial Intelligence Internet of Things, AI + IoT) scenarios, guarantee basic functions, and provide configurable expansion functions. Its open source feature allows students to go deep into the details of CPU operation, and even design a RISC-V CPU conveniently. This can help students gain a deep understanding of the cooperative execution process of the operating system and hardware"
