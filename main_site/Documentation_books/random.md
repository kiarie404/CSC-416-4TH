- make and all those automation development tools are very complex. You would rather read an entire OS book than learn how to create bash configs files for the linker, the compiler, the emulator, the OS itself. Is there a better way that is more intuitive?
- If software needs user to manually tweak dark magic config files, then that software is a waste of time.
- Good software has good documentation

- short names in system programming suck. wtf is asm? or lds folder? just write : assembly_code_folder and ld_linker_scripts. Mnemonics suck. " When I read your code, if I have to stop and think about what the method name might mean, it usually means that the method name is wrong." 
- Kindly dont use makefiles and bash scripts in your code folders. But what is the alternative, James?
- Avoid analogy when explaining something. If you have to use analogy, use examples that absolutely everyone will be farmiliar with. Why teach Rust while comparing it to C++, who the fuck cares about such analogies... I dont.
