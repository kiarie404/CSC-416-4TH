#### Human problems
- Huge learning curve :> taking it slow with small defined steps. Understanding one sentence at a time
- Giving Up, consistency
- Dunning Kruger effect
- Communicating half ideas. Communicating when you don't know the direction... each new day givs you a new objective.
- Overwhelming course work 

#### Technical
- Poorly documented libraries, mnemonics in variables, documentation mostly consisted of 'linux config installations" that were not easily compatible with Manjaro Linux ==> later switched to Linux mint(more generic)
- Bash programming language is weird, had to use nu shell
- Makefiles were weird and hard at the beginning due to scarce learning resources ... but I eventually found a tutorial
- Learning the Rust Language
- Learning Assembly language
- Trying to understand compiler libraries, they are above my understanding so I had to depend on Blogs, stackoverflow and chatgpt
- Use of unsafe Rust code and Macros: this is a whole new language
- Use of unsafe language features
- Lack of tutorials tailored for novices
- Chinese translation. (direct translations) ==> gave up on a definitive tutorial (rcore)
- Switching from x86 to riscv :
    - x86 had a hard learning curve
    - the philosophy of riscv was appealing
    - Riscv has scarce resources {tutorials, too formal documentation, halfmade-compilers(not as plug n play as those of x86)}
