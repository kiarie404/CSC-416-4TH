# memory_safety

What is memory safety in the software world? Before we get to know the answer to tha question, let's cover some necessary theory 

At the heart of every computer is a CPU. The CPU is an indiscriminate piece of hardware, from the moment it is turned on it constantly repeats the execution cycle. The execution cycle involves : Fetching the instruction addressed in the Program counter register, incrementing that counter and finally executing that instruction.

Software on the other hand, can be boiled down to : A set of addressable instructions that instruct the CPU on what to crunch,  read and write to the computer's memory. Software is deemed to be safe if it only does what it was meant to do
