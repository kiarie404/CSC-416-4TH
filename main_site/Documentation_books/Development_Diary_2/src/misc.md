## Pressure
There is so much pressure. I am tired.  
Filled with fear from school, from parents. From brothers.  
I am fighting, but I fail anyways.  
I am so tired.  
Why do people give birth.   
Giving birth is inhumane.   


## Falling to grow
Low level Systems programming.  
You think to yourself, "I would want to write code for innovative systems one day",
"for example a Mars rover, or nanobots, or BILL-Es"

You start to write cmd programs, you write a kernel.  
You mess around with Rust, riscv, wasm.  
Your school projects are onverdue by months.    
Your pride in your abilities can't let you settle for an easy project.  
You fail university, hell-bent on finishing a master-level projet, just to prove to yourself that you can be an awesome systems programmer.   
Your friends who took up marketable skills are making money.    
You are happy for them. You are still in your teenage room.  
You cannot call yourself a man? You have nothing.  

Even with all thee months of constant practice, you have nothing marketable to show.  
Who cares about a hobby kernel?  
You mean that is your achievement?  
Kid are you dumb?  
Others are making money by making websites and data models  
All these years studying Computer Science, can't you make anything usable?  
Can't you reason that low level systems development is not marketable?  
You are unemployable.   
Systems development is for senior developers, wake up to reality.   
You are book smart but not wise,  
You can't implement your nanobots, you need more knowledge to do that   

"But this path feels right,  
I am willing to be poor,  
As long as I become the developer I wanted to be,   
A developer who took the path but sure path of engineering  
Knowledge and Peace over external validation"

Maybe one day, you will write for those nanobots or Bill-Es
