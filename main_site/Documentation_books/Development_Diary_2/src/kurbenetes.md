What are microservices and why do we need them?  

What does kurbenetes do ?
- ensure availability of all needed microservices.
- regulate the number of microservice instances . As a result it can be used to automate scalability. for example, If a certain microservice is in more demand, it may duplicate that microservice across more nodes and enforce parallel execution.
- Load balancing across the distributed nodes
- Disaster recovery eg. Having multiple instances of a microservice or saving the state of a microserice in a portable form.
