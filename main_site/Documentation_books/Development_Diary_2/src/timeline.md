# Timeline

- Do the wasm book wasm_checkers + rust_checkers
- Learn Rust Traits and generics
  - Into & from trait
  - Display Trait
  - Iterators
- Do Exercism Exercises
  - learn how to read external crates
  - Grapheme libraries
  - Display Trait (ToString, .to_string(), Formatter)


## 27/06/2022
- continued doing exercism, had to learn Rust collections. Especially Hashsets
- updated the sandbox repo (hash-maps, vectors, strings, unit-testing)
    - pushed median in Rust sandbox
    - pushed pig-latin in Rust sandbox

## 28/06/2022
- Continue learning about hashmaps, build a mini database structure using a hashmap
- Do more exercism exercises (lifetimes)

## 29/06/2022
- closures
- Do more exercism exercises
- Start fiddling with the wasmi crate

## 30/06/2022
- Learn how to use the wasmi library. Torn between leraning which version
- I will learn the old one first, then move on to the new one
- In the End I chose to go with the old version. It has a tutorial + it gets the job done. It satisfies my needs.
- Today was a success. 


## 11/07/2022
I have finished reading. Now it is time to write my own paper.  
Today I intend to 
- Learn how to divide my codebase as crates
- Learn how to create a singleton structure
- Learn about libC... but for a custom OS
- Learn how to make the Rust compiler compile for a custom OS... with a custom std-library
- Read the designs and come up with a complete sketch

## 16/7/2022
- Testing in a n o_std environmet
- dynamic traitst\

## 18/7/2022
- writing code for peripherals, UART downfall
- I am somehow understanding that reality is harsh. But I will not reason out of fear. Let the consequences come. I will only do what I want. All this pressure, all this stress can be ignored.  

## 22
- Write Page allocator
- Read No_std testing
- Test Page Allocator
- Write MMU
- Test MMU
