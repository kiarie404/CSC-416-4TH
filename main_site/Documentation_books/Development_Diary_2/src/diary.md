So what if the exercises from exercism take you days to complete. You are realising that you are not an aesome Rust programer as you thought you were.  
This is the path of growth.  
The fact that you are finding the exercises hard, means you are learning something. Come on, we are finally implementing the concepts you once learned. Things like test driven development, ttraits, generics, using std libs, using multiple crates, lifetimes.   
This is the path to get good at programming in Rust. Ignore the pressure from reality. You have neither money or time. No hope for a better tomorrow. But we can continue learning. Cool. Ignore the pressure.

I am making progress. I have not started implementing the actual project. I am learning Rust slowly. This is for the best. I have overan all deadlines. I am sure I will fail this project by the standards of the university's time-limits.     
The progress I am making is negligible when I compare it to what I intend to achieve. But my pace will increase once i have got a hang of rust,wasm and riscv.  
One day at a time. One day at a time. Now I listen to some Njerae music and sleep

I will be an awesome ~~computer~~ sciectist. With or without approval of any kind of authority or standards.

I am making progress. But I wonder, maybe I should do a minimum of 30 exercism exercises.   
You see, I need to start working on the actual project.  
Or maybe I should focus on the topics I need eg: concurrency, closures, error-handling, smart pointers and do that server project in Rust.
I have so much to do. But my pace is slow compared to where I want to be. I am not even employable yet.  
My degree has gone down the drain. 4 years gone.    
All I can do is ignore the pressure. IGNORE THE PRESSURE and keep going at my slow pace
