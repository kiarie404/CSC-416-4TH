# hobo_takes_meaning

So, I failed to build the project in 6 months. That was expected. But I always thought otherwise.   
I was disappointed, but now I am proud that I had the guts to do a project that was beyond me.  
I am glad I tested my mettle.   


The project was a statement to my future self, a reminder that I can do hard engineering endevours... despite my lack of skills.   
And I learnt a lot.  
I will probably not graduate this year. I sometimes get devastated when this thought crosses my mind... and sometimes the same thought makes me so proud of failing.  
In the end, Hobo will eventually become an awesome reminder to the future me; an awesome engineer, who primarily takes on hard projects for the fun of it. Without fear of failure. Without settling for less in the name of safety or quick fixes.  


Now, I begin again.  
This time with a slow heart.    
Life is hard, I will need to move out of my parents house.  
I feel a constant pressure. I have no-one. I am alone. Sometimes I get so very afraid of the future.    
And I resort to basic addictions.   
I can't say that I have any solid skills.   
And there is no jobmarket for junior developers who are involved in Rust, wasm and Riscv. All systems programming.  

I need to master my craft and do awesome projects.  
I also need to think of novel engineering ideas... or look for specific projects that I would like to be part of.   
I dread working just for the sake of mere survival. I cannot go back to being a cashier. I need to find work that feels like home.   

Now I advocate for Antinatalism. The world is a vast dark ocean. You swim or drown. Everyone dreams of far away islands.    
Why would anyone bring other humans to this hell? It is inhumane to give birth.   


At First I did not know why it felt right to call this project "Hobo OS".   
But now I do.   

I subconciously knew that I would fail the project.  
I knew that even if I got a hang of the skills, my skillset would be niche and that finding a job would be hard.  
I knew that I would end up homeless due to lack of money.  
And I knew that my pride would not let me settle for other skills that are on demand.  
I was bound to end up homeless. And this was a journey of me making peace with that.    

It is my first lesson that would be important in my journey to pursue knowledge.    

I was subconciously willing to be a loser in the pursuit of this skillset.  
I am willing to go homeless for this.   
It has finally clicked.  

So I draw the three swords again ; Rust, wasm and Riscv.    
And I will train at my own pace, no matter how heavy the swords get.
And I will figure out my own fighting stances and breath techniques.     
Until I master them upto the point that I can actualize my own engineering ambitions.   



I will be a gentle and skilled swordsman.   
I am willing to be a loser for this.
